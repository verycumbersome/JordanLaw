    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class='paragraph-text'>
        Hows it going? My name is Matthew Jordan and thanks for stopping by my website. This is a
        place to pretty much keep tabs on who I am and what im working on.
    </p>

    <p class='paragraph-text'>
        My first program I wrote was in 3rd grade on the Blender 3D engine to make a math-based
        video game for a school project. I used python exclusively for the first 5 years of my
        programming experience and to this day it remains one of my favorite languages. A few years
        later I had moved on from 3D games and onto web development.
    </p>

    <p class='paragraph-text'>
        My first web development project I worked on was for my friend's music collective. The
        project involved port forewarding an Apache web server on a dinky 2009 mac mini running
        and old version of Snow Leopard. While working on the site, I learned about new languages
        and software such as HTML, CSS, PHP, and Apache. This early experience proved pivotal to
        my early love of web dev.
    </p>

    <p class='paragraph-text'>
        After graduating into highschool, I discovered the robotics team and quickly joined. While
        on my team, I not only learned new languages but how to apply them as well. The languages
        and libraries I learned/improved on during my time there were Java, Javascript, Python, and
        OpenCv.

    <h4><a href='https://github.com/SouthEugeneRoboticsTeam/vision'>FRC Vision Processing</a></h4>
    <p class='paragraph-text'>
        This is the vision proccess that our team had running in parrallel on a minnowboard for
        the 2017 FRC challenge Steamworks. It uses OpenCv to threshold images and return the
        position relative to the camera and uses the offset to aling the robot.

    <h4><a href='https://github.com/verycumbersome/InteractiveOutdoorNetwork'>IOP Class Website</a></h4>
    <p class='paragraph-text'>
        This website was created to help manage and organize one of my school classes Interactive
        Outdoor Program. The class is designed to integrate teenagers with the wilderness by
        allowing and encouraging outdoor activities. One of the goals of this website was to help
        promote and organize outdoor activity. The website is built on the Django python framework
        and is being hosted through WSGI on pythonanywhere.com.
